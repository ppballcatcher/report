\begin{abstract}
In the following pages the design and implementation process of a ping pong ball catcher is described. The machine consists of a squared base sensored with four piezo sensors in the corners so it is able to calculate the position of a hit in the base. 
When a ping pong ball hits the base, a robotic arm will move in to catch the ball after the first rebound.
The system is equipped with an FPGA that calculates the position of the hit and move the arm, whereas a computer program shows the hits into an interface and save a history of the balls.
