In the following pages the design and implementation process of a Lego brick sorter is described. The project consists in being able to recognize a Lego brick's color and use an actuator so the Lego brick will be collocated in a defined position. For this purpose, a FPGA will be programed to read the color from a photodiode and move a servo. The requirement of make the project modular, facing other future projects, a main PCB board is designed so extension boards can be used with the FPGA. The main PCB power the extension modules at the same time it is used for the communication between them and the FPGA.
