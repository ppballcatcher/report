\chapter{Methodology and Equipment}
\label{chap:methodology}
	In order to complete the project a number of methods and materials were used.

	\section{Methodology}
	\label{sec:methodology}
		The whole project can be divided in four parts that will be treat separately, being this: $mechanics$, $electronics$, $programming$ and $computer program$. At the same time this tasks were organized so:

		In the mechanics part the schedule was:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Design of the structure
			\item Manufacturing of the laser cutter machine parts
			\item Manufacturing of the 3D printed parts
			\item Structure assembly
			\item Add sensors and electronics to the whole structure
		\end{itemize}

		In turn, the electronics part:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Circuit design
			\item First prototype test in breadboard
			\item Manufacturing of the PCB boards
			\item Testing
		\end{itemize}

		Whereas in the programming part:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textcolor{red}{Blabla}
		\end{itemize}

		To finish, the computer program was divided in:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item UI conceptualization
			\item Serial research and first test
			\item Develop of the whole program
			\item Testing
		\end{itemize}

	\section{Equipment}
	\label{sec:equipment}
		To develop and test the designed solution the following equipments were used.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Oscilloscope
			\item Multimeter
			\item Soldering iron
			\item \textcolor{red}{FPGA Spartan 3??}
			\item Eagle 7.1 Light
			\item Breadboard
			\item PCB development instruments
			\item Printer
			\item DC servo motor
			\item Murata piezo sensor 7BB-20-6L0
			\item 3D printer
			\item Laser cutter machine
		\end{itemize}
