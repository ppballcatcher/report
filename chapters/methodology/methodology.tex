In order to complete the project a number of methods and materials were used.
\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
The workload in this project can be divided into PCB-design, manufacturing and high- and low-level programming. Since the workload is large in the low-level programming all multiple people were working on it. Whereas the workload for the other parts were mainly distributed to individuals, to maximize resource utility.   

\subsection{PCB Design and manufacturing}
The design for PCB with the piezo electric elements were conducted by first doing some research on the working principles of the piezo. Since it turn out to be rather hard to theoretically design the PCB  a more pragmatic approach were conducted. 
The sensor characteristics were analyzed by mounting it with a big potentiometer in parallel and measuring the generated voltage when hitting the base plate with a ping pong ball.
Based on this analysis a prototype where put together and tested on a breadboard. 
Then the design from the breadboard are drawn as a schematics and a board in eagle. 
After verifying the schematics and board one of the four identical PCB's are manufactured and tested before producing the others.
Other simpler electrical connections are manufactured on stripboards to minimize time spend on producing PCB's.
