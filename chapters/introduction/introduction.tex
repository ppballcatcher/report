	\section{Overall description}
		The goal of this project is catching a ping pong ball released above a platform, on which four piezoelectric elements are placed in a rectangular pattern as shown in Figure \ref{fig:sideview}. Once the ball has hit the platform once, each of the piezo elements will generate a signal and permit triangulation of the impact point. When the impact point has been found, a net will catch the ball when it returns toward the platform after the first bounce.

		Overall the different tasks of the project are thus:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Calculating the xy-coordinate of the impact point
			\item Moving an arm -- holding a net -- to catch the ball after it has bounced once
		\end{itemize}
