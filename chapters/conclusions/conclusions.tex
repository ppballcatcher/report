\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

After the design and implementation of the project and have carried out all the experiments to determine the reach of the machine abilities, we are able to conclude that we have achieved the general purpose of the project but no the reliability and the precision we expected.

On one hand, the project has been split in a way that has let us work in parallel and in an efficient way so each person in the group has had workload in every moment.
Furthermore, all the general goals for each task has been reach as, for example, in the mechanical part a functional structure has been designed and implemented along with the electronics, that has proved in the tests to be reliable, fast and robust enough to satisfy the requirements of the project.
Moreover, in the programming part, we have shown the skills to develop a high-level programming UI that works as expected establishing a fast and stable connection between the FPGA and different computers with different operative systems.
Regarding the FPGA programming, the implementation of a code able to, not only to measure data from the ADCs, but transform that information into coordinates that after will be sent to the UI has been implemented.
On the other hand, we haven't develop a system able to catch all the balls though the problems that cause this has been located and solutions has been presented.
Based on this, on the experiments carried out and comparing with other projects already mentioned, we can conclude that the general purpose of the project has been reached.
Also we believe that we have not only shown that we have  achieved the requirements of the course but we have further develop our knowledge in fields like FEM, MicroBlaze or digital design.
