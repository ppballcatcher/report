Hej \cite{anon09}


% * Platform material/size/shape.
%   - correctly determine wave velocities
% * Use additional (more than 4) sensors.
% * No comparator circuit; instead sample continuously and cross-correlate signals
%   in FPGA to find time time-lag.
% * Even a small deviation in measurements results in a big difference in final (x,y) position.
% * If more than a single pulse, one can average TODA of each of the pulses
