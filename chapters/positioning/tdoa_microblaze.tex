\section{Solving TDOA on Microblaze}
In this section the design of a solution of the TDOA problem using the microblaze microcontroller system(MCS) are described.

\subsection{Gauss-elimination}
The system of linear equations described in section \ref{tdoaPositioning} can be solved with a number of numerical methods. The simplest to understand and implement of those are probably Gauss-elimination which isn't the ideal solution since it is rather slow. It is chosen nether the less since tests showed sufficient response times to move the arm under the ball between bounces.
